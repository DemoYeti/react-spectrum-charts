# Prism

## @aaui/prism

Declarative library for composing spectrum visualizations in React.

## Install

Prism is for internal adobe use only so you will need to be on an Adobe network (onsite or via VPN) to install.

If you have never installed a package from the `@aaui` registry, you will need to make sure the following are in place to authenticate:

-   Add the `@aaui` registry to the `.npmrc` in your repository
    -   `@aaui:registry=https://artifactory.corp.adobe.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-aaui-release/`
-   Add the correct token for `@aaui` in your local `.npmrc` file

Once these are in place, you are ready to install!

```
npm install @aaui/prism
```

or

```
yarn add @aaui/prism
```

See our [Getting Started](https://git.corp.adobe.com/AnalyticsUI/prism/wiki/Getting-Started) docs for more information on how to get Prism up and running in your application.
